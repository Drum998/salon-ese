# Salon ESE Migration Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for updating your salon-ese Docker container from an older version to include all recent Service Management Enhancements.

## üö® Important Notes

- **Backup your data** before running migrations if you have important data
- **Stop the application** before running migrations
- **Test thoroughly** after migration to ensure everything works correctly

## üìã Pre-Migration Checklist

1. **Check current container status:**
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

2. **Note your current data** (if any) that you want to preserve
3. **Ensure you have the latest code** from the repository

## üîÑ Migration Steps

### Step 1: Stop the Current Container

```bash
# Navigate to your salon-ese directory
cd /path/to/salon-ese

# Stop the current containers
docker-compose down
```

### Step 2: Backup Database (Optional but Recommended)

If you have important data you want to preserve:

```bash
# Create a backup of your database
docker exec salon-ese-db-1 pg_dump -U postgres salon_ese > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
```

### Step 3: Update Code

Ensure you have the latest code with all the new features:

```bash
# Pull latest changes from repository
git pull origin main

# Or if you're working with a local copy, ensure all new files are present:
# - migrate_stylist_timings.py
# - Updated models.py, forms.py, routes/appointments.py
# - New templates in app/templates/appointments/
```

### Step 4: Rebuild Container with Latest Code

```bash
# Rebuild the container with no cache to ensure all changes are applied
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Start the containers
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 5: Run Database Migrations

Wait for the containers to be fully started, then run the migration scripts in order:

```bash
# 1. Run the HR system migration (NEW)
docker exec -it salon-ese-web-1 python migrate_hr_system.py

# 2. Run the multi-service appointment migration (if not already done)
docker exec -it salon-ese-web-1 python migrate_appointments_multiservice.py

# 3. Run the stylist timings migration
docker exec -it salon-ese-web-1 python migrate_stylist_timings.py

# 4. Run the stylist-service associations migration
docker exec -it salon-ese-web-1 python migrate_stylist_service_associations.py

# 5. Run the stylist timing waiting time migration
docker exec -it salon-ese-web-1 python migrate_stylist_timing_waiting_time.py
```

### Step 6: Verify Migration Success

Check that all migrations completed successfully. You should see output like:

```
‚úì StylistServiceTiming table created
‚úì waiting_time column added to Service table
‚úì StylistServiceAssociation table created
‚úì custom_waiting_time column added to StylistServiceTiming table
‚úì Migration completed successfully!
```

**Note:** Each migration script will show its own success messages. If any migration fails, check the error message and ensure the previous migrations completed successfully before retrying.

### Step 7: Test the Application

1. **Access the application** at `http://localhost:5010`
2. **Log in** with your existing credentials
3. **Navigate to "Stylist Timings"** in the menu (for managers/owners)
4. **Navigate to "Stylist Associations"** in the menu (for managers/owners)
5. **Check "Services"** page to see waiting time fields
6. **Test booking an appointment** with the new features
7. **Verify custom waiting times** work in stylist timing forms

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails with "Table Already Exists"

If you see errors about tables already existing:

```bash
# Check what tables exist
docker exec -it salon-ese-web-1 python -c "
from app import create_app
from app.extensions import db
from sqlalchemy import inspect
app = create_app()
with app.app_context():
    inspector = inspect(db.engine)
    print('Existing tables:', inspector.get_table_names())
"
```

### Container Won't Start

If the container fails to start:

```bash
# Check container logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Check for port conflicts
docker ps

# Restart with fresh build
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

### Database Connection Issues

If you can't connect to the database:

```bash
# Check database container status
docker ps | grep salon-ese-db

# Check database logs
docker logs salon-ese-db-1

# Restart database container
docker-compose restart db
```

## üóëÔ∏è Nuclear Option: Complete Database Reset

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This will completely delete all data in your database!**

If migrations fail repeatedly or you encounter persistent database issues, you can perform a complete database reset. This is especially useful for fresh installations or when you don't need to preserve existing data.

---

### Step 1: Stop All Containers
Stop the application and database containers.
```bash
# In your salon-ese project directory:
docker-compose down
```

---

### Step 2: Remove the Database Volume
This deletes ALL data in the PostgreSQL database.
```bash
# Remove the database volume (named 'salon-ese_postgres_data'):
docker volume rm salon-ese_postgres_data

# (Optional) Verify the volume is gone:
docker volume ls | grep salon-ese
```

---

### Step 3: Clean Up Docker Resources (Optional)
Remove stopped containers, unused images, and unused volumes. Only do this if you are sure you don't need them for other projects.
```bash
# Remove stopped containers:
docker container prune -f

# Remove unused images:
docker image prune -f

# Remove unused volumes:
docker volume prune -f
```

---

### Step 4: Rebuild and Start Fresh Containers
Build everything from scratch and start the containers.
```bash
# Rebuild containers with no cache:
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Start containers in the background:
docker-compose up -d
```

---

### Step 5: Wait for Database Initialization
Wait for the database to be ready before proceeding.
```bash
# Watch the database logs until you see:
# "database system is ready to accept connections"
docker-compose logs -f db
```

---

### Step 6: Run Database Migrations
Run the migration scripts to create all tables with the correct schema:
```bash
# Run each migration in order (these will create tables with the correct schema):
docker exec -it salon-ese-web-1 python migrate_appointments_multiservice.py
docker exec -it salon-ese-web-1 python migrate_stylist_timings.py
docker exec -it salon-ese-web-1 python migrate_stylist_service_associations.py
docker exec -it salon-ese-web-1 python migrate_stylist_timing_waiting_time.py
```

**Note:** The migration scripts will create all necessary tables with the correct schema, including the `booked_by_id` and `waiting_time` columns.

---

### Step 7: Add Sample Data
Populate the database with sample services and test users.
```bash
# Add sample services:
docker exec -it salon-ese-web-1 python init_services.py

# (Optional) Add test users:
docker exec -it salon-ese-web-1 python add_test_users.py
```

---

### Step 8: Verify Fresh Installation
1. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:5010
2. Log in with test credentials:
   - Manager: `manager_1` / `12345678`
   - Stylist: `stylist_1` / `12345678`
   - Customer: `cust_1` / `12345678`
3. Check that the app works as expected.

### Troubleshooting Nuclear Reset

#### Database Won't Start
```bash
# Check if port 5432 is in use:
netstat -an | grep 5432

# (Linux/Mac) Kill any process using port 5432:
sudo lsof -ti:5432 | xargs kill -9

# Restart containers:
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Permission Issues
```bash
# (Linux/Mac) Fix volume permissions:
sudo chown -R 999:999 /var/lib/docker/volumes/salon-ese_postgres_data

# (Windows) Run Docker Desktop as Administrator
```

#### Container Health Check Fails
```bash
# Check database logs for errors:
docker-compose logs db

# Manually test DB connection:
docker exec -it salon-ese-db-1 psql -U salon_user -d salon_ese -c "SELECT 1;"
```

---

### When to Use Nuclear Reset
- ‚úÖ Fresh install or development
- ‚úÖ Migrations fail repeatedly
- ‚úÖ No data to preserve
- ‚ùå Not for production or if you need to keep data

---

### Alternative: Selective Table Reset
If you only want to drop specific tables:
```bash
# Connect to the database:
docker exec -it salon-ese-db-1 psql -U salon_user -d salon_ese

# Drop a table (replace table_name):
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS table_name CASCADE;

# Exit psql:
\q

# Rerun the relevant migration script:
docker exec -it salon-ese-web-1 python migrate_specific_table.py
```
