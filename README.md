## ⚠️ Static File Serving: Development vs. Production

### Development
- The Dockerfile is configured to use Flask's built-in development server (`python run.py`).
- This allows Flask to serve static files (such as images, CSS, and JS) directly from the `static/` directory.
- You can access static files at URLs like `/static/images/your_image.png`.
- **Troubleshooting:**
    - If static files are not being served (404 errors), explicitly set the static folder and URL path in `run.py`:
    ```python
    import os
    static_folder = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), 'static')
    app = create_app()
    app.static_folder = static_folder
    app.static_url_path = '/static'
    ```
    - This is necessary if `run.py` and `static/` are siblings in the project root, to ensure Flask serves static files correctly.

### Production
- In production, it is recommended to use Gunicorn (or another WSGI server) to serve the Flask app.
- **Gunicorn does not serve static files by default.**
- You must use a web server such as **Nginx** or **Apache** to serve static files from the `static/` directory.
- Example Nginx configuration:

```nginx
location /static/ {
    alias /app/static/;
}
```
- This ensures efficient serving of static assets and better performance/security.
