# Salon ESE - Hair Salon Management System

A comprehensive, role-based authentication and management system for hair salons, built with Flask and PostgreSQL. This system provides secure user management with multiple access levels, from guest users to salon owners.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Flask 2.0.1 with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 13 (production) / SQLite (development)
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login with role-based access control
- **Forms**: Flask-WTF with CSRF protection
- **Containerization**: Docker with docker-compose
- **Testing**: pytest with coverage reporting
- **Timezone**: pytz for UK timezone support (BST/GMT)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Static File Serving: Development vs. Production

### Development
- The Dockerfile is configured to use Flask's built-in development server (`python run.py`).
- This allows Flask to serve static files (such as images, CSS, and JS) directly from the `static/` directory.
- You can access static files at URLs like `/static/images/your_image.png`.
- **Troubleshooting:**
    - If static files are not being served (404 errors), explicitly set the static folder and URL path in `run.py`:
    ```python
    import os
    static_folder = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), 'static')
    app = create_app()
    app.static_folder = static_folder
    app.static_url_path = '/static'
    ```
    - This is necessary if `run.py` and `static/` are siblings in the project root, to ensure Flask serves static files correctly.

### Production
- In production, it is recommended to use Gunicorn (or another WSGI server) to serve the Flask app.
- **Gunicorn does not serve static files by default.**
- You must use a web server such as **Nginx** or **Apache** to serve static files from the `static/` directory.
- Example Nginx configuration:

```nginx
location /static/ {
    alias /app/static/;
}
```
- This ensures efficient serving of static assets and better performance/security.

   cd salon-ese
   ```

2. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   - Web Interface: http://localhost:5010
   - Database: localhost:5432 (PostgreSQL)

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set environment variables**
   ```bash
   export FLASK_ENV=development
   export FLASK_APP=run.py
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

## üìä Database Models

### User Model
- Core user information (username, email, password)
- Role-based access control
- Account status and verification tracking

### Role Model
- Role definitions with permissions
- Hierarchical access levels
- JSON-based permission storage

### UserProfile Model

## üïê Timezone Support

### UK Timezone Handling
The application uses UK timezone (Europe/London) for all datetime operations:
- **BST (British Summer Time)**: GMT+1 from March to October
- **GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)**: Standard time from October to March
- Automatic daylight saving time transitions
- All timestamps stored in UTC but calculated from UK time

### Timezone Functions
- `uk_now()`: Returns current time in UK timezone
- `uk_utcnow()`: Returns current UK time converted to UTC for database storage
- Used throughout the application for consistent time handling

### Testing Timezone
```bash
# Test timezone functionality
python test_timezone.py
```
