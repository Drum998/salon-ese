## üöÄ How to Continue Development
1. **Pull the latest code and documentation.**
2. **Run both migration scripts** in your Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it salon-ese-web-1 python migrate_appointments_multiservice.py
   docker exec -it salon-ese-web-1 python migrate_stylist_timings.py
   ```
3. **Rebuild and restart the Docker containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
