## 🎯 **Development Guidelines**

### **Code Standards**
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use type hints where appropriate
- **HTML/CSS**: Use Bootstrap 5 classes, maintain responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS preferred, use modern ES6+ features
- **Testing**: Create test scripts for new features
- **Documentation**: Update README.md and relevant docs

### **Security Considerations**
- **Authentication**: All routes require @login_required
- **Authorization**: Use @roles_required for role-based access
- **CSRF Protection**: All forms include CSRF tokens
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation on all inputs
- **SQL Injection**: Use SQLAlchemy ORM, avoid raw SQL

### **Database Guidelines**
- **Migrations**: Use Flask-Migrate for schema changes
- **Relationships**: Proper foreign key constraints
- **Indexes**: Add indexes for frequently queried fields
- **Data Integrity**: Use database constraints and validation
