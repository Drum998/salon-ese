## üöÄ How to Continue Development
1. **Pull the latest code and documentation.**
2. **Run all migration scripts** in your Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it salon-ese-web-1 python migrate_appointments_multiservice.py
   docker exec -it salon-ese-web-1 python migrate_stylist_timings.py
   docker exec -it salon-ese-web-1 python migrate_stylist_service_associations.py
   docker exec -it salon-ese-web-1 python migrate_stylist_timing_waiting_time.py
   ```
3. **Rebuild and restart the Docker containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
4. **Test the application** using the checklists in `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` and `README.md`.
5. **Test the new stylist-service associations feature**:
   - Access "Stylist Associations" from the navigation
   - Create associations to restrict stylist-service combinations
   - Test booking appointments to ensure restrictions work
6. **Test the new custom waiting time feature**:
   - Access "Stylist Timings" from the navigation
   - Create or edit stylist timings to see the custom waiting time field
   - Verify that waiting time auto-populates with service defaults
   - Test booking appointments with custom waiting times
6. **Pick up the next open task** from the list above and continue development!
